ML is a subset of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly program. ML extract knowledge from data.Machine learning uses data to detect pattern and creat a model and adjust prorgam action accordingly.Machine learnig steps are :traning data, learning algorithm, model, test data, accuracy.

Machine learnig Application:
1. Siri
2. Healthcare
3. Retail

types of machine learning: 

Supervised learning: where data set contains input and output called as labelled data. You have some features data and you know the output of this features. 


HOw a problem is solved using machine learning?

Is this A Or B? >>> Clasification
Is this wierd? >>> Anomaly detection
HOw much or how many? >>> Regression algorithm
